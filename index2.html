          elektron.live can be considered as an online stage or a virtual
          performative space. One of its main driving forces is to bring
          performers and audiences together (with the use of a two-way
          streaming) while minimizing the restrictions to access since any
          number of audience members is possible.

          When inventing and building elektron.live we realized that the
          platform could be something more than only a way of demonstrating
          performers and audience to each-other. We have never had a medium
          before where there is a live interaction on both sides of the screen
          simultaneously! We also learned that performing arts online could
          never be the same as we know it from real encounters. With the
          invention of a new virtual space we also have to invent a new kind of
          performing arts. And that is something that really boosts our
          curiosity in what to look for in the future. A whole new world in
          arts!

          Much like the first movies at the turn of 20'th century were just
          recordings of the theatre performances, until now the online shows on
          the internet are copies of the shows made in real life. Despite having
          the internet for many decades, we are still inventing this medium for
          performing arts. It took Dziga Vertov and his "Man with the movie
          camera" to make movies look like movies. We are now creating a tool
          for artists to do the same for the online performances.

          elektron.live is created by e⁻lektron team together with Stepan
          Bolotnikov and Babahh Media.
